# VkPhotoTest
Hi, this app is showing how do i sole VK-Photo test-case.
This is a simple, 4 screen's app, written from code without any non-standard frameworks!
To install and run app you need only clone it from gitHub to Xcode, no extra moves.

All screens allowed portrait-orientation only.
At the first Screen you can login or rigister. Btw, app already has a first member - Admin with pass:1234
On the second screen, you will see the last 100 photos from your library or the ones you choose. Here you also can exit to first screen or see all users of the app by clicking on "Exit" or "Users".
If you click on an image from the Library, it will open in a new window with a larger size. Here you can go back to previous screen or set this image as avatar by clicking on "Set avatar".

I tried to find all the errors of the app and cover them with Alerts. I hope you enjoed it. Thanks for your time!
